# Open questions

Workers append here when the spec does not cover something. **Do not guess and do
not improvise an interface.** File the question and stop — a stopped agent is
cheap, a confidently wrong one is expensive.

The Architect answers by amending the spec, then records it in `CHANGELOG.md` and
marks the question resolved with a link to the spec section.

### Q-001 — Example, delete when the first real question lands
Raised by:   worker / T-000
Blocking:    no
Question:    Does a remote stand bus count as a ground handling vehicle for the
             purposes of the turnaround job list, or as a passenger flow corridor?
Why it matters: It decides which module owns it, and therefore which delay
             category its lateness reports under.
Status:      OPEN

### Q-002 — How much sim time does one tick represent?
Raised by:   architect / Phase 0 spec completion
Blocking:    T-001, T-008, T-009 (everything expressed in ticks)
Question:    `01-architecture.md` locks `TICK_MS = 100` at 1x, which fixes the
             tick *rate* in real time but not how much *sim* time a tick carries.
             The Architect has provisionally set `SIM_SECONDS_PER_TICK = 6`
             (`spec/08-interfaces-core.md` §8.2): 14 400 ticks per sim-day, and a
             sim-day lasting 24 real minutes at 1x.
Why it matters: It is a pacing decision — how long a day feels — and pacing is
             human-owned, not an agent call. It also sets the resolution of every
             delay minute and the tick cost of the 500-day soak. Changing it later
             invalidates every golden hash and every tick-valued fixture, though
             no interface.
Status:      OPEN — HUMAN DECISION. Workers may build against 6 s/tick; do not
             author golden hashes until it is confirmed.

### Q-003 — "500 sim-days in minutes" versus the per-tick budget
Raised by:   architect / Phase 0 spec completion
Blocking:    no (nightly soak only)
Question:    `01-architecture.md` justifies the plain-.NET sim by requiring 500
             sim-days to run "in minutes on a build agent". At 6 s/tick that is
             7.2 M ticks; even at 0.1 ms/tick it is 12 minutes, and at the max-tier
             budget of 6 ms/tick it is 12 hours. The soak is therefore only
             "minutes" if it runs against a small fixture, not the max-tier one.
Why it matters: If the soak silently ends up running at max tier it will be
             disabled for being slow, and `02-determinism.md` forbids disabling a
             gate. Better to declare the soak fixture size now.
Proposed:    Soak runs a mid-tier fixture sized so per-tick cost stays under
             0.1 ms; max-tier performance is covered separately by the budget
             tests in `03-module-map.md`. Needs sign-off because it narrows what
             the nightly gate actually proves.
Status:      OPEN — HUMAN DECISION
