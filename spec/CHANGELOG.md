# Spec changelog

Every spec change is recorded here. The human owner reviews this file weekly — it
is the cheapest way to detect the architect agent drifting.

## 0000-00-00 — initial — scaffold created
Reason:      Project start
Impact:      none
Signed off:  pending

## 2026-09-21 — spec/08-interfaces-core.md — new file: `sim.core` public interfaces
Reason:      Phase 0 tasks T-001 to T-006 cannot be released without the interface
             they implement (`03-module-map.md`: "Any interface not listed in this
             spec does not exist"). Defines sim time, `Fx`, ids, `ISimSystem` and
             the fixed tick phase order, the event bus transport, the command
             queue, the RNG service, state hashing, logging and content access.
Raised by:   human directive — complete the Phase 0 specification
Impact:      none, additive. No code exists yet; no merged work is invalidated.
             Unblocks T-001..T-006 and T-009.
Signed off:  not required, but see LOW CONFIDENCE below
Notes:       Pins algorithms that are effectively part of the save format:
             xoshiro256** + SplitMix64 seeding, FNV-1a-64 hashing, Q31.32 fixed
             point. Changing any of them later is a migration, not a refactor.

## 2026-09-21 — spec/08-interfaces-core.md §8.2 — LOW CONFIDENCE: `SIM_SECONDS_PER_TICK = 6`
Reason:      `01-architecture.md` locks the tick *rate* (10 Hz at 1x) but not how
             much sim time a tick carries. Every schedule fixture, delay figure
             and soak estimate needs it, so Phase 0 cannot start without a value.
Raised by:   architect, during Phase 0 completion
Impact:      Sets a sim-day at 14 400 ticks and 24 real minutes at 1x. Changing it
             invalidates every golden hash and every tick-valued fixture — but no
             interface. Cheap to change now, expensive after T-009 lands goldens.
Signed off:  **PENDING HUMAN** — this is a pacing decision, which `CLAUDE.md`
             reserves to the owner. Filed as Q-002. Workers may proceed; the
             Verifier must not bless golden hashes until it is confirmed.

## 2026-09-21 — spec/09-interfaces-flow.md — new file: `sim.flow` public interfaces
Reason:      Phase 0 tasks T-007, T-010 and T-011 — the kill gate — need the
             cohort model, the queue throughput model and the promotion contract
             specified before implementation.
Raised by:   human directive — complete the Phase 0 specification
Impact:      none, additive. Unblocks T-007, T-010, T-011, T-023.
Signed off:  not required
Notes:       The load-bearing decision is §9.1: the cohort is the only
             authoritative state and an agent is a derived view that can never
             write back. This makes `01-architecture.md` promotion rule 4 and the
             `determinism_promotion` gate true by construction rather than by
             care. It also means agent visual variety draws from
             `flow.presentation`, the one RNG stream excluded from the state hash.
             Narrower than `01-architecture.md` strictly requires: individual
             passenger identity is *derived* from `(CohortId, index)`, never drawn,
             so naming a passenger in the delay tree consumes no randomness.

## 2026-09-21 — spec/09-interfaces-flow.md §9.6 — LOW CONFIDENCE: deterministic least-cost routing
Reason:      A cohort choosing between two security halls or three gates needs a
             rule. Chose lowest predicted traversal-plus-wait, ties by ascending
             `NodeId`, with no RNG.
Raised by:   architect, during Phase 0 completion
Impact:      Additive. Risk is visual and behavioural, not structural: every
             cohort takes the same door, and two queues can oscillate. The
             mitigation, if playtest shows it, is a content-declared proportional
             split — never an RNG draw, which would cost promotion neutrality.
Signed off:  not required; flagged for the owner's playtest attention

## 2026-09-21 — spec/10-events.md — new file: event catalogue consumed by `sim.delay`
Reason:      `06-delay-attribution.md` requires live attribution through the event
             bus and forbids reconstruction, but never listed the inbound events.
             Without the list, eight modules would each invent their own shape and
             `sim.delay` would be built against none of them.
Raised by:   human directive — complete the Phase 0 specification
Impact:      none, additive. Constrains every future emitting module: the envelope
             (`Cause` reference), the emission discipline (one event per state
             transition, paired blocked/unblocked), and the catalogue itself.
             Unblocks T-024 and the Test Author's delay tests.
Signed off:  not required
Notes:       The model is milestones plus blocking intervals: modules report what
             they were waiting on, at the moment they waited. `sim.delay` performs
             no inference. §10.5 fixes the allocation arithmetic so that
             `sum_of_leaves_equals_total` (`06-delay-attribution.md` rule 1) holds
             by construction — largest-remainder settlement, ties by ascending
             `EventId`.

## 2026-09-21 — spec/10-events.md §10.5 — LOW CONFIDENCE: first-blocker-wins for concurrent causes
Reason:      When two causes block the same flight over the same minute, that
             minute must go to exactly one of them or leaf sums stop matching the
             total. Chose the interval with the lowest `EventId` — the one that was
             blocking first.
Raised by:   architect, during Phase 0 completion
Impact:      Affects tree *contents*, not interfaces. Under-reports a genuine
             second cause that started later and would have delayed the flight
             anyway. The alternative — proportional splitting — is fairer and much
             harder to read, which cuts against "legible failure"
             (`00-overview.md` pillar 3).
Signed off:  not required; the owner should review once the delay tree is visible
             in a build

## 2026-09-21 — spec/03-module-map.md — per-module budgets filled in, plus measurement protocol
Reason:      The table was TBD and `01-architecture.md` delegates the apportioning
             here. Module tests must assert a number, and "TBD" is not one.
Raised by:   human directive — complete the Phase 0 specification
Impact:      none, additive. The five named splits in `01-architecture.md`
             (flow 2.5, baggage 1.0, airside 0.8, turnaround 0.5, delay 0.4) are
             reproduced unchanged; only that document's "everything else combined
             0.8" line is apportioned, into ten modules totalling 0.72 plus a
             0.08 reserve held by the Architect. Total remains 6.00 ms.
Signed off:  not required — the locked total and its named splits are untouched
Notes:       Also adds the measurement protocol, because a budget measured
             differently by two agents is not a budget: reference machine,
             max-tier one-day fixture, mean ≤ budget and p99 ≤ 2x budget, zero
             allocation in the update path. Off-tick ceilings for checkpoint
             hashing (20 ms) and snapshot writes (250 ms) are marked LOW
             CONFIDENCE — they are estimates with no measurement behind them and
             T-011 is the first chance to correct them.

## 2026-09-21 — spec/open-questions.md — Q-002, Q-003 raised by the Architect
Reason:      Two Phase 0 questions the Architect must not answer alone. Q-002: how
             much sim time a tick carries is a pacing decision. Q-003: the locked
             rationale "500 sim-days in minutes" is not reachable at max-tier cost,
             so the soak fixture size needs declaring before the gate becomes slow
             enough that someone disables it.
Raised by:   architect, during Phase 0 completion
Impact:      Q-002 blocks nothing today but should be settled before T-009 commits
             golden hashes. Q-003 affects the nightly soak only.
Signed off:  **PENDING HUMAN** on both
